- I’m @dawnappears (wow)
- I’m interested in ... everything ... That's why I waste my time trying to learn every tool I see and, as conclusion, I always end up with nothing ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React + JS and CPP for competitive programming. I'm weak at algorithms if you're interested
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of projects. I'll be insanelly happy if I get an invitation to work with someone.
